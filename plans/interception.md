# UFO Interception System: Detailed Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the development of a comprehensive UFO Interception and Combat System for XbitoCom. Each phase includes UI changes and testable outcomes to ensure progress can be validated.

## Phase 1: Radar Detection System

**Goal:** Create a radar system that alerts players to UFO activity.

### Tasks:
- **Implement Radar Coverage Map**
    - Create a map overlay showing circular outlines for radar coverage from player bases. The coverage isn't affected by any conditions, it's plain and standard for any continent.
    - Display using border thickness and color (gradients of blue to indicate strength with the darker sharper blue indicating more strength) as a visual indicators of radar strength based on radar facility level.
    - Implement radar detection range based on facility upgrades, 20% effectiveness bonus per level, with a max of 4 upgrades, that is up to level 5 radar facility.
    - Take into consideration that as the game advances there can be multiple bases in one or more continents and all radar coverages should still be viewable.
    - The world map should have a button to turn off radar coverage display situated in the SidePanel.
    - The Radar coverage display should change any time a Radar facility is added to a base and when a Radar facility is upgraded.
    - Do not care about UFOs at this moment, this is focused on Radar and coverage.
    - At this stage Radar facilities do not decay, they "work" even without personnel assigned.
    - At this stage Radar range and strength is not affected by research, only by the facility level at each base.

**Verification:**  
Radar coverage displays correctly on the map, with clearly shown radar strength and detection range; player can see how radar upgrades affect coverage.

## Phase 2: UFO Tracking and Encounter Generation

**Goal:** Design a system to track detected UFOs and generate UFO encounters.

### Tasks:
- **UFO Spawn and Trajectory Generation**
    - Starting from turn 2, each new turn will have a fixed random chance to spawn 1 UFO.
    - The spawn chance will be based on configurable game parameters (excluding threat level since that mechanism is not defined yet).
    - When a UFO spawns, immediately generate a random trajectory.
    - The trajectory generation must include a runtime check to ensure it is within bounds of the map.
    - The trajectory must cross at least 1 continent. It is a straight line, on any direction as long as it complies with the 1 continent rule.
    - The length of the trajectory is from one border of the map to another, not necessarily the opposite.
    - There is a fixed chance that the UFO's trajectory will intersect with the radar coverage area of one or more bases. The first UFO spawn should cross a radar coverage from a base with a very high chance.
    - If an intersection occurs, detection is automatic and the UFO is flagged for observation.
    - Add flight path visualization for detected UFOs.  The trajectory of the UFO is rendered in the map with a Darkish Red line and some shadow.
    - Create simple animations for UFOs entering or leaving radar coverage. UFOs shouldn't travel that fast.

- **UFO Detection Notifications**
    - Design a notification panel for new UFO detections.
    - Add sound effects for UFO detections.
    - Create toast notifications confirming new detections when a trajectory crosses a radar.
    - Implement a UFO detail panel showing estimated size, speed, and mission type.


**Verification:**  
UI displays UFOs moving across the map with appropriate indicators; alerts appear when new UFOs are detected; player can view UFO details and predicted trajectories.

## Phase 3: Interception Mission Launch System

**Goal:** Allow players to scramble aircraft to intercept UFOs.

### Tasks:
- **Aircraft Readiness Display**
    - Create hangar status view showing available interceptors.
    - Display aircraft status (ready, refueling, repairing, etc.).
    - Show armed weapons and fuel status for each craft.
    - Add maintenance timer indicators.

- **Pilot Assignment Interface**
    - Implement pilot roster showing skills, fatigue, and specializations.
    - Create drag-and-drop interface for assigning pilots to aircraft.
    - Add pilot readiness indicators and warning system for unsuitable assignments.
    - Design pilot skill preview showing effectiveness against detected UFO type.

- **Mission Launch Controls**
    - Create "Scramble" button with confirmation dialog.
    - Implement mission parameter settings (engagement distance, weapons usage rules).
    - Add fuel range visualization on map.
    - Design interception approach strategy selector.

**Verification:**  
Player can view available aircraft, assign pilots, set mission parameters, and launch interceptions through UI; visual feedback confirms launch.

## Phase 4: Combat Engagement System

**Goal:** Develop interactive combat mechanics for UFO encounters.

### Tasks:
- **Combat View Interface**
    - Create split-screen view showing interception in progress.
    - Implement distance/closing speed indicators.
    - Design aircraft and UFO status displays showing damage and systems.
    - Add combat log with real-time updates.

- **Combat Control Mechanics**
    - Implement tactical controls (distance management, attack runs).
    - Create weapon firing controls with cooldowns and ammo tracking.
    - Add evasive maneuver options based on pilot skills.
    - Design "break off" and "pursue" controls for engagement management.

- **Combat Resolution Visualization**
    - Create combat animations (weapon fire, hits, misses).
    - Implement damage visualization on both aircraft and UFOs.
    - Design critical hit effects and special weapon impacts.
    - Add victory/defeat/escape animations.

**Verification:**  
Players can view and control combat encounters; UI updates with combat actions; animations provide clear feedback on outcomes.

## Phase 5: Post-Combat Outcomes

**Goal:** Handle mission results, rewards, and consequences.

### Tasks:
- **Mission Results Screen**
    - Create detailed mission summary with timeline.
    - Implement statistics display (hits, damage, time to intercept).
    - Design rewards display (research points, recovered materials).
    - Add experience gains for pilots.

- **Resource Management Updates**
    - Create aircraft damage reporting interface.
    - Implement repair cost and time estimates.
    - Add recovered UFO components inventory.
    - Design pilot injury and fatigue management screen.

- **Analytics Dashboard**
    - Create UFO encounter history with filterable data.
    - Implement performance metrics for different aircraft types.
    - Add pilot performance comparisons.
    - Design research recommendation system based on encounter data.

**Verification:**  
Post-mission UI shows results, rewards, and consequences; resources are updated correctly; analytics provide useful data.

## Phase 6: Integration with Research & Progression

**Goal:** Connect combat outcomes to game progression systems.

### Tasks:
- **Research Integration**
    - Create research projects unlocked by UFO encounters.
    - Implement UFO technology analysis interface.
    - Add research boost mechanics from recovered materials.
    - Design tech tree visualization showing combat-related unlocks.

- **Aircraft & Weapon Upgrades**
    - Create upgrade interface for interceptors based on research.
    - Implement weapon effectiveness comparison tools.
    - Add upgrade installation and testing interface.
    - Design loadout optimization recommendations.

- **Pilot Development System**
    - Implement pilot experience and leveling interface.
    - Create specialization paths based on combat performance.
    - Add skill training simulator mini-game.
    - Design pilot medal and achievement system.

**Verification:**  
Combat results influence research options; upgrades improve performance in subsequent encounters; pilots develop specialized skills.

## Testing Strategy

- **Visual Testing:** Each UI component should be manually verified for appearance and responsiveness.
- **Functional Testing:** Create automated tests for game mechanics (detection probability, combat calculations).
- **Integration Testing:** Verify that combat outcomes correctly affect research, resources, and progression.
- **User Testing:** Create test scenarios for common interception situations to evaluate balance and fun factor.

This plan provides a roadmap for implementing a complete UFO Interception System with clear, testable deliverables at each stage.
