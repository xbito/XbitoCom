# UI Redesign Plan for Global Defense Agency

## Header Updates
- In the header use a smaller font size and a more subdued color for a modern, minimalist look.

## Sidebar Reorganization
- Remove the blue background and apply a darker gradient for a sleeker appearance.
- Update the sidebar buttons to match the new design:
    - Use flat, rectangular buttons with no borders.
    - Update button colors to be more of a greenish and blackish proposed palette

## Map Styling
- Adjust the map in `WorldMap.tsx` to match the proposed design:
    - Use a darker background with gradients slightly brighter in the center and darker towards the borders of the map.
    - The continents should have a glowy appeareance

## Bottom Panels
- Update their styling to use a darker background with colored text for emphasis.
- Ensure panels like **"Global Network"**, **"Personnel Status"**, and **"Threat Analysis"** are visually consistent with the new design.

## Introduction Modals
- Make the introduction modal more consistent with the new dashboard and world map styling. Focus specifically on the buttons, fonts, colors, effects and highlights around that part of the UI.
