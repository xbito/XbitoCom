This is a React application built with Vite, we can only use ES module imports instead of CommonJS require statements. Avoid require.
Use lucide-react icons to provide some iconography to the app.

Use simple control flows, no recursion.
All loops must have a fixed upper bound.
Keep functions under 60 lines.
Use TypeScript types and runtime checks. Use the assert library and insert runtime checks.
Prefer block-scoped variables.
Always catch Promise rejections, handle errors and validate parameters.
Avoid overly clever Typescript features.
Minimize complex callback chains.
